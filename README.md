Lab 3 Task:
Write the code for the task from the lab â„–2
When writing a program, you need to use the python code convention.
Classes need to be properly divided into packages.
Working with the console or console menu should be minimal.
Only those classes that are on the class diagram should be present in the code
Class attributes and their visibility must match those specified in the class diagram. The same goes for class methods
Use the built-in sorting methods available in Python to sort
Sorting should be implemented in a separate method
The code does not contain static methods / attributes. The code must use an enum type
The code should be filled in a separate repository, having previously created a pull request (ie the code should be written in a separate branch on its basis to make a pull request)
To test the operation of your code, you need to create a separate class that will contain the main method

Lab 2 Task, implemented in lab 3:
A clothing store. Form a hierarchy of goods present in the clothing store. Implement the search for clothes needed for the reception. Sort search results by brand
Implement the ability to sort found goods by another type of parameter (optional, implemented as a separate method)
The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order.

To run the program:
Clone/Download LabNo3 branch
  - Go into the folder
  - Type `python3 main.py` in cm
